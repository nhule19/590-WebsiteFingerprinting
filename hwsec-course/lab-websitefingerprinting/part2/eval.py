        ### 1. Load data from traces file
        traceFilePath = "hwsec-course/lab-websitefingerprinting/traces.out"
        with open(traceFilePath, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read() # dictionary with keys "traces" and "labels"

        data = json.loads(content)
        X = data["traces"]
        y = data["labels"]

        ### 2. Split data into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test with train_test_split
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

        ### 3. Train classifier with X_train and y_train
        model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=300, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        ### 4. Use classifier to make predictions on X_test. Save the result to a variable called y_pred
        y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

        # Do not modify the next two lines
        y_test_full.extend(y_test)
        y_pred_full.extend(y_pred)

    ### TODO: Exercise 2-5 (continued)
    ### 5. Print classification report using y_test_full and y_pred_full
    print("\nClassification Report: \n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
     # add functionality
